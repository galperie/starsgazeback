# Starsgazeback

"A philosopher once asked, 'Are we human beause we gaze at the stars, or do wegaze at them because we are human?' Pointless, really..'Do the stars gaze back?' Now, that's a question" - Neil Gaiman, Stardust (the book which my favorite movie is based)

a movie API for me to keep track of the movies I wanna watch.
